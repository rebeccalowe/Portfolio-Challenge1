# Portfolio-Challenge1

## User Story

As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's functional deployed portfolio of work samples, so that I can have access to their contact information as well as review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. 


## Description

This portfolio displays general information, contact information, and photo work samples of a beginner full-stack developer for employers to review and consider for hire. Upon viewing the portfolio, employers will discover a webpage that has a responsive layout and will adjust to multiple viewpoints, as well as a functional navagation bar that will direct them to corresponding parts of the page. Additionally, when employers hover over each photo, they will find a title and description of that project.
